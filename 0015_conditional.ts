/*
One of the features of newer javascript versions that we are able to use in the typescript
language is a simple, streamlined version of then else statement, wich uses a
question mark (?) symbol to define the if statement and a colon (:) to define the then and else path.
*/

// (conditional) ? (true statement) : (false statement)

//Example:
const value: number = 10
const message: string = value > 10 ? "value is larger than 10" : "value is 10 or less"

console.log(message)

/*
Here we can see that the message variable has been set to the string value of "value is 10
or less", because the value > 10 conditional check returned false.

Conditional expressions are a very handy syntax to use in place of the long.winded syntax we
would normally have to use in order to code a simple if then else statement.
